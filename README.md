### Dependencies

* NumPy
* pygame
* math
* sys
* time


### Steps to run the implementation

1. Download the files from canvas
2. Install latest version of Python and the required libraries mentinoned above prior to running the code
3. Open the project file in any IDE. (eg: VSC)
4. Run the program
5. Exploration of nodes starts and the optimal path is displayed on the screen for 10 secs

## Results

#### Understanding the Output Plots

- Start node and the spanning tree from start node are represented in green color
- Goal node and the spanning tree from goal node are represented in yellow color
- Middle node and the spanning trees from middle node are represented in orange color
- Optimal path is represented in pink color
